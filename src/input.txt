Key Management Enhancements
    1. Password-Based Key Derivation 
        Allow users to generate encryption keys from strong passwords using algorithms like PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt.
        This avoids storing raw keys and strengthens security against brute-force attacks.
    
    2. Key Rotation and Expiry - done
        Implement a mechanism for automatic key rotation after a certain period or number of uses.
        Mark older keys as deprecated but still usable for decryption.
    
    3. Secure Key Storage 
        Integrate with OS-level key storage solutions like Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, or Linux Gnome Keyring for 
        enhanced key security.
        Alternatively, encrypt keys using a master key derived from user credentials.
    
    4. Key Encryption with Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
        For critical environments, consider integrating with an HSM for key generation and storage.

Encryption Enhancements
    1. Hybrid Encryption
        Use RSA or ECC to encrypt the AES key, and AES for encrypting file content. This makes key management more secure.
    
    2. File Integrity Verification
        Generate and store a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the original file to verify integrity post-decryption.
        Alert the user if the file has been tampered with.
    
    3. Multiple Encryption Layers
        Allow multi-layer encryption, where files are encrypted with multiple keys (optional feature for high-security needs).
    
    4. Metadata Protection
        Encrypt not just the file content but also metadata (like filename, size) to prevent information leakage.


Authentication and Authorization
    1. User Authentication for Key Access
        Implement user authentication before accessing or decrypting a file, possibly using Firebase Authentication.
        Restrict access to files based on user roles.
    
    2. Audit Logs
        Maintain an encrypted audit log that records all encryption and decryption operations for accountability.
    
    3. Time-Limited Access
        Enable time-limited decryption, where files can only be decrypted within a certain timeframe.

Anti-Tampering and Security Checks
    1. Digital Signatures
        Sign encrypted files using a private key to ensure authenticity. Verify signatures before decryption.
    
    2. File Poisoning Detection
        Check for unexpected or corrupted file structures that could indicate tampering or poisoning attempts.
    
    3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        Require a second factor, like an OTP or hardware token, before decrypting sensitive files.


Network Security Enhancements
    1. Secure File Sharing
        If file sharing is added, ensure secure transmission over TLS and add options for encrypting files with the recipientâ€™s public key.
    
    2. Remote Key Storage
        Consider optional integration with cloud-based key management services (like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS).


GUI Improvements for Security
    1. Visual File Integrity Checks
        Display hash values or validation status directly in the GUI for user awareness.
    
    2. Sensitive Operation Warnings
        Show warnings before overwriting existing encrypted files.
    
    3. Clipboard Sanitization
        Automatically clear sensitive data (like passwords or keys) from the clipboard after use.

Backup and Recovery
    1. Encrypted Backups
        Offer an option to automatically back up encrypted files.
    
    2. Key Recovery Process
        Build a secure, user-friendly key recovery process in case of lost keys.



What if the user wants to encrypt multiple files and then decrypt them?
